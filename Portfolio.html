			Above is a fractal design I made in Java back in highschool as an applet. I have translated it to JavaScript to demonstrate here.
			Refresh to watch it change colors!

			Above is an image of a GUI Project I made. I created an interface where you
			can click on any string and fret on the guitar and create notes or chords which could then be strummed. Another feature
			was added to allow it to save a sequence of notes or chords and play them at a specified tempo.

		<p class="leftAlign">
			Above is an animation that was created with a bunch of stars that were statically drawn in random sizes and positions around the screen.
			The UFOs, spaceship and asteroids were all given a random speed and run on different threads. The UFOs and spaceship moved to
			the right while the asteroids moved left.

			Above was a project designed using queues to keep up with drawn circles. Whenever too many circles were drawn it would erase
			the oldest one and draw a new one in front. Whenever it collided with the edges of the screen it changed colors, direction and
			speed.

			This is a video of our final presentation for our team's marble sorter project freshman year. This was developed in MatLab originally and then translated to LabView. The
			coding is what I contributed to the most. The design was built out of different materials which had to fit in a budget. The device runs by first sorting all the
			marbles into slots. The sorting seperated by material, color and size. After, it scans barcodes and dispenses the correct amount of marbles of each type. In this
			demonstration it reads 3 different barcodes. When there weren't enough marbles then an alarm would sound. We managed to make it to the contest for the Galveston campus
			where we placed 2nd and were able to attend the demonstration at College Station.

			This shows the results of confirming the color and name changes to Player 1 and then dropping the player count by 1.

		<img src="./CatanDieRoll.png" class="image">
		<p class="leftAlign">
			This is the part of the game where everyone rolls a die to see who goes first. It rearranges the players in a sorted manner as each player rolls.
			It also highlights whose turn it is to roll.
		</p><br>
		<img src="./CatanPiecePlacement.png" class="image">
		<p class="leftAlign">
			Here is a display of the interface within the game. The world tiles were all randomly given a number and color based on the resource it contains.
			The dice can be rolled and then options selected for the current turn. The custom pieces shown were placed manually based on the closest valid point
			to where I clicked on the world. All vertices were highlighted for debugging purposes while generating the world.
