	<h3>Projects worked on in High School</h3>
	
	<h4 class="leftAlign"><u>Fractals Applet</u></h4>
	<canvas id="fractal" width="667" height="667" style="background-color: white;"></canvas>
	<p class="leftAlign">
		Above is a fractal design I made in Java back in highschool as an applet. I have translated it to JavaScript to demonstrate here.
	</p>	
	<hr>
	
	<h4 class="leftAlign"><u>Screen Saver</u></h4>
	<img src="./ScreenSaver.png"/>
	<p class="leftAlign">
		Above was a project designed that used queues to keep up with drawn circles. Whenever too many circles were drawn it would erase
		the oldest one and draw a new one in front. Whenever it collided with the edges of the screen it changed colors, direction and
		speed.
	</p>
	<hr>
	
	<h4 class="leftAlign"><u>Guitar GUI</u></h4>
	<img src="./GuitarGUI.png"/>
	<p class="leftAlign">
		Above is an image of a GUI Project I made. I created an interface where you
		can click on any string and fret on the guitar and create notes or chords which could then be strummed. Another feature
		was added to allow it to save a sequence of notes or chords and play them at a specified tempo.
	</p>
	<hr>
	
	<h4 class="leftAlign"><u>Multithreaded Animation</u></h4>
	<img src="./Animation.png"/>
	<p class="leftAlign">
		Above is an animation that was created with a bunch of stars that were statically drawn in random sizes and positions around the screen.
		The UFOs, spaceship and asteroids were all given a random speed and run on different threads. The UFOs and spaceship moved to
		the right while the asteroids moved left.

	<h3>Projects worked on in College</h3>
	<h4 class="leftAlign"><u>Lego Marble Sorting Project</u></h4>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SVMyGQ8wqc8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<p class="leftAlign">
		This is a video of our final presentation for our team's marble sorter project freshman year. This was developed in MatLab originally and then translated to LabView. The
		coding is what I contributed to the most. The design was built out of different materials which had to fit in a $60 budget. The device runs by first sorting all the 
		marbles into slots. The sorting seperated by material, color and size. After, it scans barcodes and dispenses the correct amount of marbles of each type. In this
		demonstration it reads 3 different barcodes. When there weren't enough marbles then an alarm would sound. We managed to make it to the contest for the Galveston campus
		where we placed 2nd and were able to attend the demonstration at College Station.

	<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
	
	<h4 class="leftAlign"><u>Catan Board Game</u></h4>
	<p class="leftAlign">
		Below is a number of pictures illustrating different parts of the game which is a recreation of the board game of the same name.
	</p>
	<img src="./CatanMenu.png" width="480"/>	
	<img src="./CatanPlayers.png" width="480"/>
	<p>
		These pictures show the main menu and player select screens. All the buttons were custom made.
	</p>
	<img src="./CatanColorPick.png" width="480"/>
	<img src="./CatanNameChange.png" width="480"/>
	<p>
		Above are the custom made color picker and name changer which allowed changing of those features of a player. 
	</p>
	<img src="./CatanUpdatedPlayer.png" width="480"/>
	<p>
		This shows the results of confirming the color and name changes to Player 1 and then dropping the player count by 1.
	</p>
	<img src="./CatanDieRoll.png" height="480"/>
	<p>
		This is the part of the game where everyone rolls a die to see who goes first. It rearranges the players in a sorted manner as each player rolls.
		It also highlights who's turn it is to roll.
	</p>
	<img src="./CatanPiecePlacement.png" width="1280"/>
	<p>
		Here is a display of the interface within the game. The world tiles were all randomly given a number and color based on the resource it contains.
		The dice can be rolled and then options selected for the current turn. The custom pieces shown were placed manually based on the closest valid point
		to where I clicked on the world. All vertices were highlighted for debugging purposes while generating the world.
