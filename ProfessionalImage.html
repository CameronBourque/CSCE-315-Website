		<h3>Work Experience:</h3>
		<p class="leftAlign">
			<i>Co-op Software Developer on the Controller Products Team at L3Harris Technologies:</i><br><br>
			&emsp; Date of employment: May 2019 - January 2020 <br><br>
			&emsp; Developed computer networking software using different protocols such as UDP or TCP to allow
			connections between different software in seperate applications and even hardware. I also developed
			a library for other applications to use to communicate with hardware. Multiple different applications
			could then include the library for use. I also worked on some applications used for software testing.
			One applications would be able to listen and send data over a socket. Another test application I worked
			on was set up to read a specific file type that had a bunch of commands and process them in order to 
			do specific tasks for our testing needs. Most projects needed an application to run multiple jobs in
			tandem and would require thread-safe queues to move data around. <br><br>
			&emsp; Coding Languages/Data Formats/Tools Used: &emsp; C/C++, C#, Python, Java, XML, Bash, JSON, CMake, Docker, Git <br>
