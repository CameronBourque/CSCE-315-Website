			Howdy! <br><br>
			
			I'm Cameron Bourque and I grew up near the Dallas, Texas area. I went to school in Plano, Texas and graduated from Plano Senior High
			School in 2017. I currently am an undergraduate student at Texas A&M University. I am majoring in Computer Science and
			minoring in Cyber Security. <br><br>

			<u>Some fun facts about me:</u> <br>
			I have played soccer since I was four years old.<br>
			I studied French throughout high school. <br>
			I play the guitar. <br>
			I enjoy skiing and photography - not necessarily at the same time - but GoPro's are pretty cool. <br><br>
			This photo I took, is one of my favorites:
