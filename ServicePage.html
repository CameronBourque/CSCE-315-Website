		I worked over 80 hours of community service in YMSL (Young Men's Service League) in the Wildcat chapter. I received a perfect
		attendence award here for 2 years and was Vice President during that time. The different work I did was spread across the
		following:<br><br>

		&emsp; Minnie's Food Pantry - I assisted with food stocking and helping people who showed up to get food. I also
		helped them paint a new building that they acquired for their charity. <br>
		&emsp; Plano Senior Center - I came here multiple times to help lead Bingo with the senior citizens. <br>
		&emsp; Heritage Farmstead - I helped them clean up the property and also helped set it up for events. <br>
		&emsp; Sci-Tech Discovery Center - I helped them clean up and also assisted them with birthday parties. <br>
		&emsp; Richardson Animal Shelter - I walked the dogs and helped them clean up the location. <br>
		&emsp; St Mark's Catholic Church - I helped them paint and also clean up the church property. <br>
		&emsp; HERO's - I helped chaperone the kids with special needs at a summer camp. <br>
		&emsp; Big Brother's Big Sisters - I helped them paint a shelter and assisted at a retail store. <br>
		&emsp; Friends of Plano Library - I assisted them with a book sale and fundraiser. <br>

		I've been a part of NSCS (National Society of Collegiate Scholars) for the past year and was able to volunteer at Clara B. Mounce Public Library where I set up and co-hosted a county fair for the library.
